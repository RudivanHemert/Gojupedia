Abstract
 Background  & Study  Aim:  In different varieties of sports karate, the rules of competition in kumite are constantly being modified. This 
underscores the importance of technical preparation in karate training. Therefore, the purpose of this article 
is to present the allowed kumite techniques in sports karate.
 Material  & Methods :  The method of analyzing the source materials was used. The current rules of kumite competition were an -
alyzed: the World Karate Federation, World Karate Confederation, World Union of Karate-Do Federations, 
World Karate Martial Arts Organization. The results were presented in the form of overview photos.
 Results :  The following are allowed: four techniques from the tsuki waza group; three techniques from the uchi waza 
group; six techniques from the keri waza group; eight techniques from the nage waza group; nine techniques 
from the uke waza group; four techniques from the kawashi waza group.
 Conclusions :  It was concluded that the criterion for allowing 34 karate techniques to be used in kumite sports competition 
is the safety of the competing athletes.

smaes.archbudo.comINTRODUCTION
In preparing athletes for sports competition in 
karate, motor, technical, tactical and mental prep -
aration are distinguished [1]. Motor preparation 
allows for developing motor skills to a high level. 
This provides the basis for perfecting techniques at 
the championship level. A  high degree of mastery of 
these gives the opportunity to achieve many tactical 
solutions. The whole is topped off by mental prepa -
ration, which allows the achieved training effects to 
be fully presented at sports competitions [2].
With the dynamically changing rules of compe -
tition in kumite in different varieties of sports 
karate, karate practitioners are forced to select 
possible techniques to prepare for sports competi -
tions [3]. That is why technical preparation is such 
an important part of karate training. In this sense, 
karate technique consists of the performance of 
a movement task adapted to a given fighting situ -
ation, in an economical way, defined by the rules, 
which uses the physical potential, mental poten -
tial and movement skills of the karateka necessary 
for sports fighting.
In general, there are dozens of karate tech -
niques [4]. To minimize the risk of injury and trauma 
in sports competition, most karate techniques have 
been banned due to their destructive nature to the 
opponent [5]. Consequently, sports karate tech -
niques can be divided into attack and defense tech -
niques. Attack techniques include tsuki waza, uchi 
waza, keri  waza  and nage waza ; while the defense 
techniques include uke waza  and kawashi waza  [6]. 
The purpose of this article is to present the 
allowed kumite techniques in sports karate.MATERIAL AND METHODS
The method of analysis of source materials [7] was 
used. The current rules of the kumite competi -
tion of four sports karate organizations were ana -
lyzed: World Karate Federation [8], World Karate 
Confederation [9], World Union of Karate-Do 
Federations [10], World Karate Martial Arts 
Organization [11]. The results are presented in 
the form of overview photos. For this purpose, 
a photo session was conducted in the sports hall 
of the Primary School in Mysłakowice (Lower 
Silesia, Poland). The techniques were presented by 
Pawel Piepiora and Maciej Baranski while the pho -
tos were taken by Zbigniew Piepiora. It should be 
mentioned that the authors of this article are mas -
ter class coaches.

smaes.archbudo.comDISCUSSION
Technical correctness is only one of the factors 
that affect the end result of a fight. It can be 
improved by motor accents in technical train -
ing, because motor preparation during a fight 
significantly determines the result of the tech -
nique performed. Therefore, the appropri -
ate relationship between motor skills and the 
motor potential of a karateka is formed dur -
ing a long-term training process. The stage of 
learning karate techniques is always the short -
est and easiest. The pace of mastering them 
depends on the karateka’s motor susceptibil -
ity. Then the skills of combining and using the 
functions of given techniques in a specific sit -
uation depending on the opponent are per -
fected. It should be emphasized here that due 
to the limitations of the rules of sports com -
bat, there is a big difference between the tech -
niques in the combat version and the sports 
version of karate. In sport fighting, karateka is 
always focused on scoring points by attacking 
the allowed areas of the opponent’s body while 
constantly controlling his techniques. Therefore, the problem of perfecting karate 
sports techniques boils down to accentuating 
and combining all those elements on which the 
effectiveness of the movements performed in 
a sports fight depends. It should be mentioned 
here that a thorough knowledge of the rules 
translates into the conduct of the athletes’ 
pursuits realized through combat. Nothing can 
replace the experience gained in sporting com -
petition as it has an impact on the develop -
ment by the competitors of their own unique 
fighting styles.
An analysis of the sports karate rules showed 
that only 34 karate techniques are used in kumite 
sports competition. Therefore, when reworking 
the technical material, it is not advisable to rush 
in search of novelty, but one should focus on 
perfect mastery of the fundamental techniques. 
Outstanding champions are examples of what 
can be reached by working systematically. The 
issue of nage waza  in sports karate is also impor -
tant. Today, this group of techniques differs sig -
nificantly from the classic nine throws of Gichin 
Photo 31.  Dodge in place. Photo 32.  Dodging with stepping off the attack line.

© ARCHIVES OF BUDO SCIENCE OF MARTIAL ARTS AND EXTREME SPORTS2021 | VOLUME 17 |  121Funakoshi [12]. Although modern sports nage 
waza  is more practical, tatami used for karate is 
not designed for falls [13]. Significant differences 
are observed between karate tatami and judo tat -
ami. In addition, karate practice does not take 
into account the kind of emphasis on falls pres -
ent in judo [14]. This shows that the problems 
with the use of nage waza  in karate are still pres -
ent and should be solved as soon as possible, 
since the personal safety of karatekas depends 
on them. However, this is only one (albeit basic) element of personal safety (security), which is dis -
cussed in a multifaceted sense by, among others, 
Gąsienica-Walczak et al. [15].
CONCLUSIONS
Thirty four karate techniques are allowed to be 
used in kumite sports competition. This is jus -
tified by the concern for the safety of compet -
ing athletes.
