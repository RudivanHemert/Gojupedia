During kime, the pelvis remains open, but the teeth clench.\n\nNote: in shiko dachi, the crown of the head is up and the chin slightly tucked (ears alert). The back forms an \"S\", shoulder blades are together and pointing down. The pelvis is open and thus tilted forward, the shin is perpendicular to the floor, and the knees are directly above the feet (initially, many karateka need to actively push the knees and thigh backwards for this). The hip is slightly higher than the knees (water would slowly flow down the thigh).

          "description": "The techniques in this series (except the elbow strike and stomp) must be performed separately and powerfully. It's important to relax (in between) after each technique. In the classical execution of Gekisai Dai Ichi, there's a count stop before the back fist strike, allowing the body to relax better. The rhythm is 1-2 and 1-2-3.\n\nMaintain the block and hikite during the front kick. The kick – lift the knee high until the thigh is parallel to the floor – is keage (so without pelvic tilt and hip rotation). The kick is straight forward with the ball of the foot towards the groin. Before the kick, sink slightly on your standing leg, and during the kick, the body is fully supported by the standing leg. You may slightly tuck your pelvis (not necessary) and do not lock it. After the kick, relax, actively pull the lower leg back until it's under the knee. From there, it's stomped down into zenkutsu dachi.\n\nThe elbow strike is primarily forward, the fist ending at the jaw. Pull the hikite back forcefully. The elbow strike and stomp are performed together and, depending on the karateka's level, can be done in three ways:\n1. The foot is stomped down, and the rebound from the ground is used in the elbow strike. The rhythm is 1 ..... 2.\n2. The foot is stomped down, and immediately after, the elbow strike is performed. The rhythm is pam-bam.\n3. The stomp and elbow strike are performed simultaneously. From the hara, power goes simultaneously to the foot and the elbow. This is called \"splitting power\".\n\nThe back fist strike is initiated from the pelvis, and during the impulse, the shoulders, elbow, and wrist remain relaxed. The technique is a whip-like strike (so there's no kime) to jinchu (vital point at the center of the upper lip). After the technique, the fist snaps back, and the elbow makes a 90-degree angle.\n\nThe low sweeping block makes a relatively small swing and rotates around the elbow. During execution, there's no tension in the shoulders and elbow. During focus, the arm turns slightly. The hikite is powerful.\n\nThe reverse punch is executed with a lot of power and speed. The movement begins by straightening the rear leg. This causes the pelvis to rotate in; this is used for the powerful impulse of the punch, focused and executed towards suigetsu. Also use a powerful and fast hikite. Kiai!",

Focus on the side of the inside of the foot, ensuring you sweep low. Stomp the foot down in hachiji dachi (= 'natural stance') and use the rebound from the ground for the impulse to the knife-hand strike; also use a powerful hikite (remains a fist). During the sweep, also spread your shoulder blades apart and somewhat forward (the back remains straight, you keep looking forward) and also use the snapping back of the shoulder blades in the knife-hand strike. In the knife-hand strike, the shoulders and elbows are free of tension. The technique is fast and briefly focused at eye level (\"heavy strike\"). For the knife-hand, the fingers are straight, and the bent thumb rests against the side of the base of the index finger. Also focus on the point of impact with the pinky-side palm heel.",

Step from hachiji dachi in a straight line backwards (slightly diagonal) into zenkutsu dachi and actively pull your hand (as if dragging someone) to your side (knuckles remain up). Straighten your leg and put your whole body behind the double punch; especially use the power from the ground and your back muscles (the fist of the reverse punch is above the knee). Step forward with your left leg and do not rise while changing feet (feet are briefly side by side; there's a moment comparable to sitting on a toilet). While changing feet, perform a mid-level inside block (chudan uchi uke) with the right hand and a mid-level outside block (chudan soto uke) with the left hand, so you look at the back of both fists. Step back and simultaneously pull the fists forcefully back to the side. Use the rebound from the ground, straightening the leg/rotating the pelvis, and back muscles for another powerful double punch (awase zuki: ura zuki (reverse punch) and chudan zuki (mid-level punch)). For the fist making the mid-level punch, during the switch, the hikite is at the side with knuckles up. The ura zuki (knuckles down during the switch) is to the seventh rib (denko), the chudan zuki to the 5th intercostal space, just below the nipple (ganka).\n\nNote: beginners may also perform the chudan soto uke as a 'regular' chudan uke, where you look at the finger side of the fist.",
