  "kata": {
    "sanchin": {
      "meaning": "Three Battles/Conflicts",
      "description": "The most fundamental kata in Goju Ryu. It focuses on proper breathing, stance, and tension throughout the body. The 'three battles' refer to the mind, body, and spirit.",
      "history": "Literally means 'three battles'. It refers not to an actual fight, but to the internal struggle to harden body, mind, and spirit through willpower. The kata consists of slow techniques performed with continuous muscle tension and deep abdominal breathing. The modern Sanchin is a variant developed by Miyagi Chojun sensei (founder, 1888-1953) based on the original passed to him by Higaonna Kanryo sensei. Breathing in the original version was more explosive, and the body turned 180 degrees twice. Advanced students may be tested for correct muscle tension during Sanchin by fellow students, who check execution by feeling and striking certain body parts. This testing is called shime. Exam material for gokyu (fifth kyu, green belt) and above.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Sanchin is considered the essence of Goju Ryu karate, embodying the principles of breathing, stance, and focus that are central to the style's philosophy."
    },
    "tensho": {
      "meaning": "Rotating Palms",
      "description": "Literally means 'rotating palms'. This kata was developed by Miyagi Chojun sensei as a counterpart to Sanchin. Like Sanchin, it is performed with deep breathing and overall muscle tension, but its character is quite different. Where Sanchin is closed, angular, and hard (go), Tensho is open, graceful, and soft (ju), with many circular hand and wrist techniques. Exam material for sandan (third dan) and above.",
      "history": "Created by Chojun Miyagi as a counterpart to Sanchin, Tensho represents the soft, circular aspect of Goju Ryu.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Tensho demonstrates the 'ju' (soft) side of Goju Ryu, complementing Sanchin's 'go' (hard) qualities."
    },
    "gekisai-dai-ichi": {
      "meaning": "Attack and Destroy, First Form",
      "description": "One of the two Gekisai kata created by Chojun Miyagi for physical education in schools. It teaches fundamental techniques and breathing patterns in a simpler format than the older kata.",
      "history": "Literally means 'attack and destroy 1'. This unusually aggressive name for karate reflects the era when Okinawa was a battlefield for Japanese-American war actions. The kata was developed in 1940 by the founder of Okinawa Goju-ryu Karate-do, Miyagi Chojun sensei. It consists of various combinations of simple basic techniques, which facilitate learning the later, more difficult classical koryu kata. Exam material for kukyu (ninth kyu, white belt) and above.",
      "culturalSignificance": "This kata was part of Miyagi's effort to popularize karate and make it accessible to a wider audience, particularly the younger generation."
    },
    "gekisai-dai-ni": {
      "meaning": "Attack and Destroy, Second Form",
      "description": "The second of the two Gekisai kata. It builds upon the techniques of Gekisai Dai Ichi with additional movements and slightly more complex patterns.",
      "history": "Literally means 'attack and destroy 2'. Like Gekisai Dai Ichi, developed by Miyagi Chojun sensei for the same reasons. Exam material for nanakyu (seventh kyu, yellow belt) and above.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Represents the evolution of karate instruction as it was being standardized for broader teaching applications."
    },
    "saifa": {
      "meaning": "Smash and Tear",
      "description": "A kata that emphasizes quick directional changes and close-range techniques. It contains grabbing, pulling, and tearing motions designed for close combat.",
      "history": "Means something like 'destructive strikes'. 'Sai' means, as in Gekisai, 'destroy'. 'Fa' means, among other things, 'strike'. Typical for Saifa are the many striking techniques, such as uraken uchi, tettsui uchi, and haito uchi. Saifa is the first classical koryu kata. The kata was passed down by Ryu Ryu Ko to Higaonna Kanryo sensei. Compared to the Gekisai Dai kata, from Saifa onwards the difficulty increases and more and more combinations of hand and foot techniques appear, requiring good coordination. Exam material for gokyu (fifth kyu, green belt) and above.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Saifa represents the evolution of martial arts techniques designed for practical self-defense situations in crowded environments."

Advanced karateka can also make an irimi step and sweep the opponent from close range. In this advanced variation, the elbow is also locked on the chest."
