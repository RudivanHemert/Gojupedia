          <p>
            The origin of our kata can only be understood in conjunction with the development of karate. Karate originated on the island of Okinawa, with Chinese (temple) boxing or Kung Fu (quanfa) as its main source. All Kung Fu styles have kata, called quans or taolu in Chinese.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exchange of martial arts between China and Okinawa has a long history and has taken place many times, both by Chinese who came to live in Okinawa and Okinawans who went to train in China. The first documented application of karate - then still called 'te' (= hand) or 'tode' (= Chinese hand) - is around the end of the 18th century, but even after that, tode would be enriched by various people.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these people taught other karate styles on Okinawa - the tode schools from that period are roughly divided into Naha-te, Tomari-te, and Shuri-te - and also had different kata. On Okinawa alone, there are still about 75 different kata in circulation, often in different versions (Bishop, 1989).
          </p>
          <p>
            During that period, the Okinawans didn't care much about what a particular style was called, and they never systematically organized all these forms. The main thing was that you trained. From 1879, Okinawa was occupied by Japan. The Japanese from the main island were interested in karate, but found that the organization was poor, the training methods awkward, the curriculum incomplete, a training uniform necessary, competitions should be organized, and there should be more cooperation between the different karate schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the turn of the century, some Okinawans also saw that further centralization of 'tode' was desirable, among other things to be able to teach it in schools. The Chinese origin of the 'tode' would have to be hidden for this and the unique Okinawan character emphasized. Tode became 'karate' and the Japanese grading system was adopted. The Japanese word 'kata' replaced the Chinese 'quan'.

            Important for the history of the kata of Goju-ryu is Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1916). Kanryo was born in Naha and trained from the age of 14 to 16 on Okinawa with a teacher who had learned kung fu in China. At the age of 16 (1869), he left for Fuzhou in China where he lived and trained for 15 years, among other things. He lived there in the house of the Kung Fu master Ryu Ryu Ko. Little is known about Ryu Ryu Ko, but he was a temple boxer of the southern style and Kanryo learned the kata from him (and probably received a book, the Bubishi). Around 1894, Kanryo returned to Okinawa.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Okinawa, he would pass on his knowledge to, among others, Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953), the founder of our style. Chojun Miyagi learned nine kata from Kanryo. In addition, Chojun Miyagi would add three more kata to our system and adapt one. Choyun Miyagi taught gym at a (high) school and developed Gekisai dai ichi and Ni in 1940 for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, these kata were just a certain sequence of movements, which were performed by the students. But in 1948, Chojun Miyagi added these two kata to the curriculum of Goju-ryu and also taught them in his own dojo. From that moment on, Gekisai dai ichi and Ni were the first two kata that karateka learned and - of course if one continued training - then the other kata.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the period before, one first learned Sanchin. If one mastered Sanchin - after a rather intensive period - the student learned only one or two other kata, so that a high degree of perfection could be achieved in these individual kata. In addition, Kanryo had learned Sanchin from Ryu Ryu Ko. This was initially performed with open hand techniques, which was considered too dangerous for schoolchildren. Therefore, Kanryo taught Sanchin with closed fists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chojun Miyagi would further adapt the kata and, among other things, change the breathing method and also add the movement to the rear (see the introduction to Sanchin). He also created the kata Tensho, based on the quan Rokkishu, and would add it to our system.
