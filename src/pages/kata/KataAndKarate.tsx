          <p>
            Kata are considered the central training form of karate training. They serve as a vehicle for the transmission of combat art and knowledge, concerning breathing, individual techniques, and movement and posture qualities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kata stand between basic exercises (kihon) and combat training (kumite). Kata are sometimes presented as a fight against (many) imaginary opponents with a characteristic choreography, but this is not entirely correct (although it can be fruitful to imagine being attacked during certain techniques). Besides techniques that can be applied in a self-defense situation, kata also contain techniques that are unrealistic to apply in an actual fight. They are added to develop certain qualities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a shiko-dachi ('wide-legged stance') rarely occurs during kumite, but frequently in kata. This stance helps develop the strength to push off quickly and move. Additionally, with many techniques, the hikite fist ("other" fist) is pulled back into the side to stimulate the development of strength from the legs and pelvis. In a self-defense situation, you're better off using this hand for coverage or controlling your opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many kata, Saifa for example, there are techniques that are deliberately performed in a narrower stance or with a small pelvic movement, so that you learn to generate power well under these more difficult circumstances. This requires more refined coordination. Kata are thus a mixture of combat applications and basic training and contain elements of kihon and kumite.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to kihon, the techniques in kata are performed alternately and during movements. This is more difficult (but also more natural) than training in kihon. In addition to kumite, kata are primarily a solo form and can therefore be trained anytime and anywhere. You don't need a partner, and you can practice the techniques over and over again if things aren't going well. This allows you to improve the techniques, for example your posture, your relaxation, or your aim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, the movements of the kata are precise and prescribed in detail. This way, you always have a reference to evaluate, improve, and perfect your techniques. Thanks to the heishugata, you develop the integration of body, breath, and mind. Thanks to the kaishugata, the execution of the techniques. In short: kata can be trained more often (and are less prone to injury) and there is more attention to the execution of your techniques, your posture, your basic qualities, and the movement qualities than during kumite.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirdly, kata are a source for techniques for your personal arsenal. Of course, you learn a large number of combat techniques from the kata. All these techniques are elaborated in a standard bunkai (which is requested, for example, during exams), which can be further developed and applied and thus serves as a basis for your personal arsenal.
