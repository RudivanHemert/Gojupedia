          <p>
            The bunkai of the first technique in Gekisai dai ichi (high upward block and punch) is performed in the standard-bunkai with a sideways evasion, foot change, and a punch to the eye. But this seemingly simple technique can also be performed in many other ways, besides the standard form. These are called oyo-bunkai.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of oyo-bunkai of this jodan age uke (high upward block) include an attack to the chin, continuing the block as a downward elbow strike (hiji ate), after the block grabbing the opponent's arm and then stepping back and pulling (hiki waza), or grabbing the other arm over the arm and continuing it as an arm lock (ude kansetsu waza). The punch can also be executed to the throat or performed as an open hand technique. The foot change can also be performed with a kick (geri), a mountain punch (yama zuki), or a circular punch (mawashi zuki) instead of with the forward punch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, different movement qualities can be applied during the bunkai-kumite, such as the block without focus but as a continuing round movement. By experimenting with the techniques from the kata in this way, you develop a large arsenal of techniques. These techniques still need to be added to your personal curriculum. In the standard bunkai, the arms are initially held alongside the body, but it is also good to practice the techniques from kaki-e or from a fighting posture.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short: such a seemingly simple technique as the first movement of the first kata can already be an enormous source of possible techniques and combinations. Used in this way, the kata are the most important source of your personal curriculum of techniques, provided they are applied supplementarily and creatively during kumite training.
