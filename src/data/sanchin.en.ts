    title: 'Effects of Sanchin training',
    description: `During sanchin kata training you are breathing very deeply, thus increasing the oxygen supply to the body as well as the brain. With this, the brain and nervous system become particularly sharp and more aware.

This type of deep breathing stimulates the diaphragm and helps to stimulate the stomach, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and intestines to become more active. Your muscles are in a state of constant tension, thus they become extremely expanded and this creates a feeling of tremendous power.`,
