    description: `Sanseru means "36" and refers to the 36 techniques in the kata. This kata was introduced to Okinawa by Kanryo Higaonna. He learned the kata from Ryu Ryu Ko. The original creator of the kata is unknown.

Sanseru is a kaishugata (open hand form) and is characterized by many open hand techniques, including shotei zuki (palm strikes) and nukite zuki (spear hand strikes). The kata develops power, speed and precision in the execution of techniques.`,

    description: `From musubi dachi, sink down and step with a circular movement with the right leg into sanchin dachi. Simultaneously, the hands go up, slide over each other at the level of the solar plexus to the side and make a circular movement forward past the elbows into morote chudan shotei uke.

The hands are more vertical than horizontal. The elbows are close to the body (about a fist away) and make a 90-degree angle. This technique develops strength and stability in the arms and shoulders.`,

In the nukite zuki, the hand is a spear: the thumb presses against the mouse of the side of the index finger, the palm and fingers are extended. The nukite is to ganka, the intercostal space between the fifth and sixth rib at the level of suigetsu.`,
