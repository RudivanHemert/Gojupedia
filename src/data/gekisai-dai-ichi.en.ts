    title: 'Upward block (jodan uke)',
    description: `Step forward with the right foot from musubi dachi, pivot on the balls of both feet, and perform the block simultaneously. Your stance should be two feet选举. The blocking arm moves close to the body, initially horizontally across the diaphragm, then straight up, turning only at the last moment. Keep your shoulders as relaxed as possible. The arm is focused a fist-width from the forehead. The hikite arm initially goes up, stays high during the body turn, and is then actively and forcefully pulled to the side. Focus powerfully. When you block, your weight is distributed evenly over both feet. Advanced practitioners can slightly turn the elbow downwards during kime and perform the technique with a somewhat rounder motion.`,

    title: 'High punch (jodan zuki)',
    description: `Push off by pressing the front foot into the ground and step straight into han zenkutsu dachi (three feet long). The pelvis does not rotate with the punch. During the kime of the punch, about 70% of your weight is on the front leg. The punch is at eye level. Also use a powerful hikite and clench your teeth during kime. Primarily use the power of the push-off and movement, keeping your shoulders relaxed for as long as possible.`,

    title: 'Low sweeping block (gedan barai)',
    description: `Step back with your right leg into shiko dachi, simultaneously opening your pelvis and letting it drop. Keep looking to the side. The hikite is pulled back forcefully (pull your elbow defectos and down). Until kime, there is no tension in the arm, and the fist ends a fist-width from the knee (in bunkai, the low block is performed as an attack to the elbow and ends further from the knee). During kime, the pelvis remains open, but the teeth clench.

Note: In shiko dachi, the crown of the head is up and the chin slightly tucked (ears pricked). The back forms an "S", the shoulder blades are together and pointing downwards. The pelvis is open and thus tilted forward, the shin is perpendicular to the floor, and the knees are directly above the feet (initially, many karateka need to actively push their knees and thighs defectos for this). The hip is slightly higher than the knees (water would slowly flow down the thigh). The feet (especially the big toe and the inside of the foot) are pressed forcefully into the ground and grip the floor during kime.`,

    title: 'Middle block (chudan uke)',
    description: `Pull the left foot towards the other foot and then in a circle forward (ankles pass each other) into sanchin dachi. The fist of the blocking hand starts far below the elbow of the other arm. The technique is performed with muchimi. This movement is executed with a fairly large circular motion, and the foot and arm move simultaneously.`,

    title: 'Front kick (mae geri), elbow strike and stomp (hiji ate and fumikomi geri), backfist strike (uraken uchi), low block (gedan barai) and middle reverse punch (chudan gyaku zuki)',
    description: `The techniques in this series (except for the elbow strike and stomp) must be performed separately and forcefully. It is important to relax (in between) after each technique. In the classical execution of Gekisai Dai Ichi, there is a count stop before the backfist strike, allowing the body to relax better. The rhythm is 1-2 and 1-2-3.

Maintain the block and hikite during the front kick. The kick – lift the knee high until the thigh is parallel to the floor - is keage (i.e., without pelvic tilt and hip rotation). The kick is straight forward with the ball of the foot towards the groin. Before the kick, sink slightly onto your standing leg, and during the kick, the body is fully supported by the standing leg. You may slightly tuck your pelvis (not necessary) and do not lock it. After the kick, relax, actively pull the lower leg back until it is below the knee. From there, it is stomped down into zenkutsu dachi.

The elbow strike goes mainly forward, the fist ending at the jaw. Pull the hikite back forcefully. The elbow strike and stomp are performed together and, depending on the karateka's level, can be done in three ways:
1. The foot is stomped down, and the rebound from the ground is used in the elbow strike. The rhythm is 1 ….. 2.
2. The foot is stomped down, and immediately after, the elbow strike is performed. The rhythm is pam-bam.
3. The stomp and elbow strike are performed simultaneously. From hara, the power goes simultaneously to the foot and the elbow. This is called "splitting power".

The backfist strike is initiated from the pelvis, and during the impulse, the shoulders, elbow, and wrist remain relaxed. The technique is a whiplash (so there is no kime) to jinchu (vital point at the center of the upper lip). After the technique, the fist snaps back, and the elbow makes a 90-degree angle.

The low sweeping block makes a relatively small swing and rotates around the elbow. During execution, there is no tension in the shoulders and elbow. During focus, the arm turns slightly. The hikite is powerful.

The reverse punch is executed with a lot of power and speed. The movement begins by straightening the rear leg. This causes the pelvis to rotate in; this is used for the powerful impulse of the punch, focused and executed towards suigetsu. Also use a powerful and fast hikite. Kiai!`,

    title: 'Foot sweep (ashi barai) and knife-hand strike (shuto uchi)',
    description: `Pull the rear foot towards the other and make a small foot sweep; the sweeping foot maintains long contact with the ground and does not pass the other. Focus on the side of the inside of the foot, ensuring you sweep low. Stomp the foot down in hachiji dachi (= 'natural stance') and use the rebound from the ground for the impulse to the knife-hand strike; also use a powerful hikite (remains a fist). During the sweep, also pull your shoulder blades apart and slightly forward (the back remains straight, you keep looking forward) and also use the snapping back of the shoulder blades in the knife-hand strike. In the knife-hand strike, the shoulders and elbows are free of tension. The technique is fast and is briefly focused at eye level ("heavy strike"). In the knife-hand, the fingers are straight, and the bent thumb rests against the side of the base of the index finger. Also focus on the point of impact with the hypothenar eminence.`,

    title: 'Double punch (awase zuki): middle and reverse punch (chudan and ura zuki)',
    description: `The double punch is a small and closed form of tora guchi. Step from hachiji dachi in a straight line defectos (slightly diagonally) into zenkutsu dachi and actively pull your hand (as if dragging someone) to your side (knuckles remain upwards). Straighten your leg and put your whole body behind the double punch; especially use the power from the ground and your back muscles (the fist of the reverse punch is above the knee). Step forward with your left leg and do not rise during the foot switch (feet are briefly side by side; there is a moment similar to sitting on the toilet). During the foot switch, perform a middle inward block (chudan uchi uke) with the right hand and a middle outward block (chudan soto uke) with the left hand, looking (thus) at the back of both fists. Step back and simultaneously pull the fists forcefully back to the side. Use the rebound from the ground, the straightening of the leg/pelvic rotation, and the back muscles for another powerful double punch (awase zuki: ura zuki (reverse punch) and chudan zuki (middle punch)). For the fist that will make the middle punch, the hikite is at the side with knuckles पेंशन during the switch. The ura zuki (knuckles down during the switch) is to the seventh rib (denko), the chudan zuki to the 5th intercostal space, just below the nipple (ganka).

Note: Beginners may also perform the chudan soto uke as a 'regular' chudan uke, where you look at the finger side of the fist.`,
