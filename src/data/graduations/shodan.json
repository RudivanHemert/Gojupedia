  "history": [
    "Sensei Chojun Miyagi went to Shanghai, China in 1936 for research and to build friendships with Chinese martial artists",
    "In 1926, Sensei Chojun Miyagi established the Karate KenKyu Club in Naha with masters from other Okinawa karate styles, Chomo Hanashiro, Choyu Motobu, and Kenwa Mabuni",
    "The purpose of the Karate KenKyu Club was to ensure the preservation of karate as an intangible cultural treasure in Okinawa for all time, to bring the karate community of the island into one cohesive force, to transmit traditional karate to future generations both in Okinawa and elsewhere, and to elevate karate in the eyes of the Japanese, bringing it to the level already enjoyed by judo and kendo."
