    step: 1,
    title: "Morote sukui uke (double scooping block) and morote gedan barai (low double sweeping block)",
    description: "The entire movement is executed with muchimi. From musubi dachi, step diagonally forward in a straight line into shiko dachi.",
    details: "The hands go up slightly simultaneously, turn and then go sideways; they circle around the lower abdomen as if around the belly of a heavily pregnant woman. Keep the shoulder low and the fingers together, the thumb pressed against the side of the index finger. When the hands come together in front of the lower abdomen, they turn upward, the fingers go straight up, the backs of the hands come together and the fingertips end just below the chin. The elbows are pressed against the ribcage. The breath goes to the tanden as the hands go up. Below the chin, the hands become fists (index finger first, with muchimi). The fists go down and the knuckles then interlock like gears. Hold the breath and tanden during the downward movement of the fists. When the fists are down, they go outward and execute a slow morote gedan barai, still with muchimi. During the morote gedan barai you exhale and the tanden/pelvis opens. At the end, focus briefly with a powerful kime, the fists then turn slightly inward."

  {
    step: 2,
    title: "Sukui uke (scooping block), hiki uke (pulling block) and nukite zuki (spear hand strike)",
    description: "This movement is also slow and with muchimi. Open both hands. The hikite goes to the side of the body, hand open and palm up.",
    details: "In the sukui uke, the direction of focus changes from inward-sideways, to diagonally upward and upward. The hiki uke is small and executed from the wrist. In the bunkai, the sukui uke goes to the elbow and you can also imagine this in the kata: grab your opponent by the elbow and the nukite goes briefly along the body with focus in the fingers and the thumb pressed firmly against the side of the base of the index finger. Pull the pulling arm powerfully to the side of the body; the nukite is diagonally downward. Step straight from shiko dachi without coming up; the feet slide over the floor."
  },
  {
    step: 3,
    title: "Hojo oshi (supporting push) and suri ashi (sliding movement)",
    description: "For the hojo oshi, place the fist in your open hand and together they rotate until the thumb pad of the supporting hand is behind the thumb pad of the fist hand.",
    details: "From shiko dachi, pull the front leg backward into a 'high nekoashi dachi'. The suri ashi is fast and powerful, the feet slide over the floor. The forward movement is from the tanden with the whole body and straight forward; the technique itself is not a strike but a push to the solar plexus. In the standard bunkai, you first strike with nakadaka-zuki and then open your hand and give a supporting push with this open hand. In the kata, you push and use the fist."
  },
  {
    step: 4,
    title: "Ushiro (backward) and chudan hiji ate (middle-level elbow strike)",
    description: "After the push, turn the fist tateken (vertical), the open hand turns with it and stays behind the thumb pad on the fist.",
    details: "This open hand stays 'stuck' so that the fist is 'pulled loose' for a powerful uraken hiji ate, while you simultaneously step backward into han zenkutsu dachi. The open hand remains extended. Then follows a powerful chudan hiji ate, the fist remains tateken forward; the forearm in the palm of the open hand. Both elbow strikes are indeed fast one after another, but not 'bouncing'. It's a fast and powerful one (uraken hiji ate) – fast loading – two (chudan hiji ate)."
  },
  {
    step: 5,
    title: "Hojo uke (supporting block)",
    description: "The technique is executed with muchimi. The fist hand goes past seigetsu and begins on the left side next to your body.",
    details: "The fist comes to rest in the palm of the other hand and together they follow the path of a chudan uke. Press the thumb of the open hand firmly and extend this hand. The pelvis is closed during the block. Also with this slow movement, extra attention to the support by the breath, breathe in during the block and out at the kime. Pay attention to the stance: it is renoji dachi, the 'L-stance'."
  },
  {
    step: 6,
    title: "Ippon gedan barai (low sweeping block)",
    description: "From renoji dachi, step with the back leg diagonally forward, the ankles go closely past each other.",
    details: "The gedan barai is executed with much power and speed. During the technique, the pelvis opens and falls into the shiko dachi and this is used in the first gedan barai. Keep the arm more or less straight. After this, the pelvis remains open, you push off powerfully with the front foot which goes straight backward, the ankles go closely past each other. This gedan barai is also executed with much speed and power. Therefore pull the hikite back powerfully and grip the ground with your feet. These two gedan barai's are the most powerful moment in the kata."
  },
  {
    step: 7,
    title: "Shotei chudan uke (middle-level open hand block) and hari uke (bow and arrow block)",
    description: "From shiko dachi, pull the front foot back and move to a shiko dachi perpendicular to the front of the hall.",
    details: "The foot makes an arc and goes past the other foot, the pelvis remains open, the back straight, the feet slide over the floor and you don't come up. The chudan uke goes with the turning of the body. The hari uke is executed with muchimi. The arm that makes the jodan technique goes – palm up – through the arm that makes the gedan uke. The jodan block is controlling and somewhat pulling at the moment of focus. The gedan block is sweeping, the arm is extended. Focus on this technique both on the fingers and on the palm of the open hands."
  },
  {
    step: 8,
    title: "Jodan uchi uke (high inward block) and uraken uchi (backfist strike)",
    description: "From shiko dachi, turn on the left leg and make a swinging step from outside to inside.",
    details: "Move from hara and come forward with the whole body. Both arms also make a large movement and come from outside to inside. In the jodan uchi uke, the fist ends in front of the face at nose height. Put equal power in both arms. You strike the elbow in the palm of the other hand. Then slip forward from the tanden with the whole body with suri ashi, the feet slide over the floor, the left hand stays around the elbow and execute an uraken uchi to the nose. There is no tension in the shoulder, wrist and elbow; there is no kime, the hand springs back."
  },
  {
    step: 9,
    title: "Chudan yoko uke (middle-level outward block) and gedan barai (low sweeping block)",
    description: "Step sideways with the front foot into a kind of bensoku dachi. Sink deep into the front foot with your full weight.",
    details: "Then push off powerfully with this foot and use this power for the 135-degree turn. Cross both arms in front of your solar plexus and simultaneously execute a fast chudan yoko uke and the gedan barai."
  },
  {
    step: 10,
    title: "Age zuki (rising punch), jodan uraken uchi (high backfist strike) and gedan barai (low sweeping block)",
    description: "Push off from your back leg and keep your right hand in 'ura zuki'. Your left hand is open and above your forehead.",
    details: "At the moment your foot comes down, pull your left hand powerfully and actively to your solar plexus and execute a powerful age zuki. The elbow makes a 90-degree angle after the punch. Then follows an uraken uchi (arm completely relaxed, fist is not focused) and a small gedan barai from the elbow. Push off powerfully with the front leg, turn on the left foot and step straight backward, ankle past ankle to shiko dachi and execute a powerful gedan barai. Pull the hikite back powerfully and grip the floor with your feet."
  },
  {
    step: 11,
    title: "Hazushi waza/Hiji ate (release technique/elbow lift)",
    description: "For a good execution of the hazushi waza, you must imagine that you are being attacked from behind. Also concentrate on the back of your body.",
    details: "The arm of the front leg lies against the body and goes to execute the release technique; it lies under the arm that shoots back for the uraken hiji age. Curl yourself up by closing your pelvis and tilting it backward, pushing your shoulders forward and pulling your shoulder blades forward and twisting the arms and wrists as far as possible together, against the body. Let the built-up tension suddenly release, like an arrow flying from a taut bowstring. The nukite arm flies back powerfully, like an uraken hiji age. The hazushi waza/hiji ate shoots powerfully upward. For the movement, bring your weight to the front leg and push off very powerfully with the ball of the foot for the backward movement. The movement is smooth but powerful, over a considerable distance and is executed with great speed."

  {
    step: 12,
    title: "Shotei otoshi uke (open hand falling block) and jodan uraken uchi (high backfist strike)",
    description: "From neko ashi dachi, move from the tanden with the whole body a considerable step with suri ashi forward into sanchin dachi.",
    details: "Simultaneously execute a shotei otoshi uke and jodan uraken uchi. The hand of the block ends in front of the solar plexus, fingers up. The backfist strike is a whiplash to jinchu."
  },
  {
    step: 13,
    title: "Morote kuri uke (double elbow block)",
    description: "For the kuri uke, the hands make a fairly large circle upward and come together above the forehead.",
    details: "The backs of the little finger pads come together, after which the elbows also come together. Bring them slowly downward, with muchimi. Focus in the elbows as they go down. Then the elbows go outward and make morote kuri uke. At the beginning of the block, the attention is on the elbows, but this shifts to the underside of the forearm, the palm and finally the fingers. Turn the hands in a fairly small circle downward, place the back of the right hand in the palm of the left and turn the hands while stepping into musubi dachi. Close the kata."
