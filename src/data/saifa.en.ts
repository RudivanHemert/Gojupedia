    title: "Hazushi waza (release technique)",
    description: "From musubi dachi, you first sink down, then powerfully push off from the back leg. You move the front leg 45 degrees diagonally forward. The movement is smooth and is often compared to a swimming octopus. You only come up when you have connected your feet, during the movement you keep your back straight and crown up.",
    details: "At the beginning of the movement, the left hand grabs the right fist, the thumb and pinky of the left hand stick out at the top and bottom of the fist respectively, so that more grip is obtained. During the hazushi waza, the arm stays close to the body. At the start of the hazushi waza, the wrist is turned outward. Initially the grip is loose, but during the technique it is firm. The actual release technique is powerful and also comes from the rotation of the body; you tilt your fist and pull AND push powerfully."

    step: 2,
    title: "Jodan uraken uchi (high backfist strike) and osae uke (controlling block)",
    description: "The rhythm of the movement from the starting position to the hazushi waza, the hazushi waza itself and the uraken uchi/osae uke is smooth/flowing – powerful – fast.",
    details: "For the uraken uchi, the arm (shoulder, elbow and wrist) is free of tension. The impulse of the movement comes from the tanden (and the falling of the pelvis), also the muscles of the upper body are almost relaxed. The uraken uchi starts close to the armpit, follows a fairly large circle (past the forehead) and comes diagonally from above to jinchu (vital point at upper lip). The uraken uchi is executed as a whiplash and the hand springs back, after which the elbow makes a 90-degree angle. The block is a circular osae uke (controlling block). This means that muchimi must be added to this fast block. At the end of the block, this hand stands up in front of the solar plexus."

  {
    step: 3,
    title: "Sukui uke (scooping block), shotei gedan harai uke (open hand low sweeping block), hiza ate (knee strike) and mae geri (front kick)",
    description: "Unlike the previous movements in shiko dachi (straight line), this movement is circular; the foot first goes toward the other foot and the ankles go closely past each other.",
    details: "The sukui uke and gedan shotei barai are executed with muchimi; the arm that makes the gedan barai slides through the elbow of the other. After the block, the fingers point forward, the fingers of the gedan hand somewhat inward. The head turns during the movement and looks to the side at the moment when the ankles pass each other. The mae geri is keage with the ball of the foot to the groin. After the kick, the foot is actively pulled back and then hangs relaxed downward."
  },
  {
    step: 4,
    title: "Morote zuki (double punch) and morote gedan uchi (double downward strike)",
    description: "After the (second) kick, you turn your head forward, move your leg powerfully backward into a zenkutsu dachi and simultaneously execute the morote zuki.",
    details: "The hands are first powerfully pulled back to the side, the knuckles remain upward; the fists do not rotate during the punch. The double punch is slightly above the shoulders, shoulder-width apart. For the morote gedan uchi, there is no tension in the shoulders, elbows and wrists; you only use gravity. Don't do anything with muscles, just let it fall. For this, the fists initially swing somewhat sideways, and then fall in a fairly large circle downward. Only at the moment of contact do you focus, with the attention point both in the fist and in the open hand."
  },
  {
    step: 5,
    title: "Chudan hiki uke (middle-level pulling block) and morote zuki (double punch)",
    description: "The hand of the hiki uke starts angled under the upper arm. You don't step sideways, but you swing the foot sideways.",
    details: "The sideways swing and the turn is one movement; there is no pause moment. The block has no kime. Use the rebound of the turn via the back leg and pelvis for the double punch. Focus powerfully."
  },
  {
    step: 6,
    title: "Ashi barai (foot sweep), tettsui uchi (hammer strike), tsukami hiki (grab and pull) and ura zuki (reverse punch)",
    description: "The ashi barai is small, the foot goes along the other foot and you stamp it in hachi ji dachi.",
    details: "Use the impulse of the sweep movement via the tanden and the powerful hikite as support for the tettsui uchi. For the hammer strike, the upper body and the joints of the arm and shoulder are relaxed. The arm remains relaxed as it makes a large circle, past the groin, the side of the body and over the head in a flowing circular movement. The tettsui uchi is powerful and on the forehead and is focused at the moment of contact on the underside of the hand. Turn and open the fist-hand, tension remains in the fingers. Imagine that you grab someone by the hair and pull them down forcefully. This hand remains more or less 'flat' and goes to your side. At the same time, you make a powerful ura zuki."
  },
  {
    step: 7,
    title: "Gyaku zuki (reverse punch)",
    description: "Turn from hachi ji dachi to han zenkutsu dachi; three feet long.",
    details: "The power for the punch comes partly from the turn, the rebound from the ground by extending the back leg and the powerful hikite. The punch is at throat height, above the collarbone. Focus powerfully."
  },
  {
    step: 8,
    title: "Haito uchi (ridge hand strike)",
    description: "Take a long sliding step toward the back, open your hands and turn into a neko ashi dachi.",
    details: "The 'gyaku zuki arm' remains relaxed and somewhat extended. Keep the body upright but relaxed; during the haito uchi there is no tension in the arm joints; the arm is thus more or less extended during execution. Use the pelvic impulse, the withdrawal of the hikite and the turn for the chudan haito uchi. Focus the haito uchi on the side of the hand! Pull the other hand powerfully back to the side, this hand is open and the palm is facing up. The fingers of the haito uchi end above this hand."
  },
  {
    step: 9,
    title: "Tora guchi (tiger mouth)",
    description: "Execute the tora guchi in a similar manner as in Gekisai dai ni and close the kata.",
    details: "The tora guchi is executed with the same technique as in the Gekisai katas, where the hands are brought into a tiger mouth position and the kata is closed with a powerful focus."
