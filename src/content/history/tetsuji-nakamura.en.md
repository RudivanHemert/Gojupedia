Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura, the man entrusted by Master Higaonna to fulfil a life time's duty of protecting traditional Goju-ryu and passing it on the next generation. In July 2012, Sensei Higaonna announced to his senior students around the world that he would be passing the flame of Goju-ryu onto Sensei Nakamura – a man who has been one of his closest and loyal students.

At the age of only 47 years old, Sensei Nakamura claims that as he is young and that he still has a lot to learn as a Karate-ka; demonstrating the kind of humility we have come to expect from his own instructor. He has committed himself to spend the rest of his life to further protect and develop Okinawan Goju-ryu Karate-do.

### Beginnings

Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura had no idea that when he began martial arts training at the age of 12, that his journey would become as serious of a life's pursuit as it has. He was born in Osaka, Japan on April 3rd, 1965 and took up Judo at the age of 12, beginning the practice of Karate in Senior high school at the age of 15. He continued his Judo practice for six years, achieving the level of 2nd Degree Black belt in the art. His commitment to his martial arts training began at an early age, with him training in Judo a minimum of five times per week.

As he entered senior high school he experienced his first introduction of Karate, practicing in a Goju Kai club for three years. Although he admits that his focus was more on Judo at this time, there was obviously a passion and appreciation for Karate that lead to him joining another Karate school upon attending university.

Sensei Nakamura attended Kagawa university and while there began training with another Goju style club. The training was physical, but focused on a lot of free fighting as the club was full of eager young men out to prove themselves on the dojo floor. Sensei Nakamura was one to hold his own and when he told the club instructor that he was heading with some friends to vacation on Okinawa during his university break, his instructor insisted he should get in contact with one his own Sensei's.

Always the loyal student, upon arriving in Okinawa Sensei Nakamura telephoned a man name Shuichi Aragaki. Unto his knowledge, Sensei Nakamura was calling a Karate Master who was one of only two private students of the Goju-ryu style founder, Bushi Chojun Miyagi, following the devastation of World War II. Aragaki Sensei was very kind to this young stranger and invited him to his home for dinner. During the meal, Aragaki Sensei told him about his training with Chojun Miyagi Sensei and what is true karate was all about. After Nakamura Sensei returned to the main land, he started thinking about Aragaki Sensei's stories often. He decided to return to Okinawa and visit Aragaki Sensei one more time to find out more out his Karate from him before he graduated University.

Upon returning to Okinawa, Sensei Nakamura contacted Aragaki Sensei and visited with him again. The Karate master then took the young man and led him to the Uehara dojo in Okinawa. Following introductions, training began. The aging Master asked the young Nakamura Sensei to punch him. Realising the age different, a Sensei Nakamura punched slowly for Master Aragaki who was taken aback. He asked again for the young man to punch him with full power. Sensei Nakamura charged in and quickly found himself on the ground numerous times. He later explained that each of Master Aragaki's punches landed precisely on vital areas each time and that he felt as if he could have been killed by the Sensei had the choice been made. Training eventually moved on to Kata training. After the Master saw the performance of his Kata he asked him 'what is this? This is not traditional Karate.'

### Move to the United States of America

So once again, Sensei Nakamura packed up his life for Karate and set off to America to pursue training under his new Master. When first arriving in California, Sensei Nakamura was living with Master Higaonna and his family, becoming an Uchi Deshi (literally a house student). He would train every morning with the Goju-ryu Master in his garage and then again with him in the afternoon and evening at his Dojo in San Marcos – the Institute of Traditional Karate. Class training with Master Higaonna is physical as it is, let alone being one on one with him and having no place to hide or leave room for error. The training was gruelling and helped forge Sensei Nakamura into the Karate warrior he would become.

### Back to Japan

In the same year, Master Higaonna realised the need for mainland Japan to have a strong headquarters and decided he would return to Tokyo to establish the Ryubukan, a Dojo that would become the centrepiece of Goju-ryu in Japan. He asked Sensei Nakamura to accompany him and the two moved to Tokyo together.

### Only the Traditional Path

In 1994 Tetsuji Nakamura Sensei was 29 years old and had just accomplished his goal of winning the IOGKF World Championships free fighting category – a task he felt pressured to accomplish having been an instructor at the IOGKF Honbu Dojo. But as he lay in bed the next morning, he thought to himself 'am I really the best in the world?' His answer to himself was no. Even though he had achieved an impressive win of the entire tournament, he still felt that compared to many of the IOGKF International senior instructors, he was only starting out as a good traditional martial artist.

It was at this point that he decided to end his competitive career to focus solely on Traditional Okinawan Goju-ryu Karate-do. He changed his personal training schedule to reflect a greater emphasis on Hojo Undo (supplementary training specific to Goju-ryu) and Sanchin practice. He felt his Karate, strength, power and speed improved drastically as he moved into his thirties.

When Sensei Nakamura declared to his parents that his intentions were to follow his Karate calling after he had finished his university degree, they were not overly impressed. His mother did not speak to him for a great length of time. But when his parents travelled to Canada in 2000 for a vacation, they quickly realised the happiness and the life that Karate had given their son. From this point on, they accepted and supported Sensei Nakamura's quest to become the best person he could be and to spread Goju-ryu across the world.

IOGKF Canada really began to grow at Sensei Nakamura's hand and at the end of 2003 he decided that it was time for him to establish his own Dojo. This was the beginning of Shudokan, now one of the world's most popular Goju-ryu Dojo's. For a number of years he taught out of a purpose built Dojo, but as his popularity grew he was soon dealing with over 180 students training regularly, it was decided that a bigger venue was needed. In 2011, a labour of love was created. A very large two story mechanics garage was transformed into the new Shudokan Dojo. Students from all over Canada and World assisted in building the new home of IOGKF Canada and soon the IOGKF World.

Today, Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura still resides in Canada with his wife Rania and two daughters, Emilie & Sophia. He is a caring family man and dedicates his time between his home life and Karate practice and instruction. He will still tell you today that he is not the best in the world. However it is this humility, coupled with the thousands of hours of sincere & dedicated practice and research that really do make Sensei Tetsuji Nakamura one of the best in World. He once remarked that he doesn't think he can ever reach Master Higaonna's level, but that he will never stop striving to do so. With this passion and spirit towards training and with the backing of the World, the future of Goju-ryu is safe and will continue to prosper under his leadership.
