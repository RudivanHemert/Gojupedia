Around this time (1954), Morio Higaonna joined the dojo of the late Chojun Miyagi. Before this, Higaonna Sensei had trained in Goju-Ryu and Shorin-Ryu under Tsunetaka Shimabukuru, Kenji Kaneshiro, and Yoshishige Omine. On the recommendation of Tsunetaka Shimabukuru, Higaonna Sensei officially joined the dojo in March 1955. During his first visit to the dojo, he met Yasuo Iba Sensei. Iba Sensei told the young Higaonna to go to Anichi Miyagi Sensei since he was the most renowned in the dojo. Although Higaonna Sensei had already practiced karate for two years, he wanted to start from the beginning. He had trained in Junbi Undo and was drilled in the Gekisai kata and the Sanchin kata. He remembers endlessly practicing Kakie, and his body was conditioned through Hojo Undo exercises such as Nigiri kamae and Makiwara.

Initially, training under master Anichi Miyagi was relatively calm; however, when Higaonna Sensei progressed and especially when he began practicing the Sanchin kata, the training became very intense. Higaonna Sensei recalls that the first ten years he trained under Anichi Miyagi involved developing speed and power and constantly repeating kata. He received detailed instruction only later.

Looking back in history, GOJU-RYU begins with master Ryu Ryu Ko in Fuzhou, South China. From there, it was passed on to the great Okinawan martial artist Kanryo Higaonna. Master Kanryo Higaonna brought Goju-Ryu to Okinawa, where it became an Okinawan art, and he passed his art on to master Chojun Miyagi. Through Chojun Miyagi, it became known as Goju-Ryu karate-do. It was intended to be passed on to master Jinan Shinzato. However, he tragically died during World War II. After World War II, Chojun Miyagi passed his art on to his most diligent student, master Anichi Miyagi. He taught him everything down to the smallest details, the highest level (Okuden) of techniques including the Hiden, or secret techniques.

Anichi Miyagi's karate is beautiful to watch; his skill has truly reached the level of an art. This is the result of six years of private instruction from Chojun Miyagi.

In August 1957, Eiichi Miyazato built a large dojo in the Asato district of Naha, which he named Jundokan - the name of Jigoro Kano's first judo dojo. Miyazato, who was also busy with judo after the war, became judo champion around 1950-51 and even went to Japan in April 1953 to attend the Japan Kodokan seminar. Eventually, Miyazato became a prominent judo master and also chairman of the Okinawa Judo Federation. Due to his authority and position as police inspector, Miyazato officially took charge of the dojo, with Koshin Iha as his assistant and responsible for tuition fees. However, they rarely taught and left the daily teaching responsibilities to An'ichi Miyagi. It was An'ichi Miyagi who, for example, taught Iha the peichurin kata.

In 1959, An'ichi Miyagi left Okinawa to work on an American-owned oil tanker. Finding work in Okinawa was very difficult at that time, and An'ichi still carried the responsibility of supporting his family. A year later, Morio Higaonna decided to go to Tokyo on mainland Japan to attend Takushoku University. During his studies, he could only return to Okinawa twice a year - one month every winter and two to three months every summer. On these occasions, he continued his training and further development under An'ichi Miyagi.

The Okinawa Karate-do Renmei was established in May 1956 with Choshin Chibana - the founder of Shorin-Ryu - as its first chairman. On December 30, 1960, this potentially powerful organization held its first dan examinations for all styles. Shoshin Nagamine of Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu was the chairman at that time. The top instructors of each style were graduated to godan, twenty-five karate-ka were graduated to sandan (among them Morio Higaonna); twenty-three were graduated to nidan; and forty were graduated to shodan.

Morio Higaonna taught for twenty years in a dojo in Yoyogi, a suburb of Tokyo. During those twenty years, he built the dojo into one that gained worldwide recognition, resulting in people with various martial arts backgrounds coming to train with him. Higaonna also introduced his teacher An'ichi Miyagi in Tokyo. During these years, An'ichi Miyagi taught his student, Morio Higaonna, the secret and highest techniques of Goju-Ryu.

In 1979, with the help of Chojun Miyagi's family, Ken Miyagi - the fourth son of the founder of Goju-Ryu - and many of Chojun Miyagi's senior students, the International Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-Do Federation (IOGKF) was established. Its aim was to preserve the original Goju-Ryu techniques unchanged and promote technical development as well as popularity, in accordance with Chojun Miyagi's wish. An'ichi Miyagi was appointed honorary chairman; Morio Higaonna was appointed world chief instructor.

In 1981, Higaonna moved to Okinawa to conduct more research and opened a dojo in Naha (Higaonna dojo). Here he was chosen by Howard Reid and Michael Croucher - documentary makers from the BBC - to represent traditional karate in the series "The Way of the Warrior".

In 1987, Higaonna went to the United States to promote Goju-Ryu. Since 1987, he visited Fuzhou many times to increase his knowledge about the Chinese 'roots' of Goju-Ryu. Through these visits, a close bond was forged between the IOGKF and the China Fuzhou Wushu Association (CFWA).

Today, the IOGKF has an enormous following worldwide; tens of thousands of students in about forty-five countries.
