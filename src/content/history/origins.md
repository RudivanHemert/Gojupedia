## Origins in Okinawa

Goju-Ryu karate was developed in Okinawa, Japan in the early 20th century by Chojun Miyagi. The name "Goju" comes from the "hard-soft" principle of traditional Chinese martial arts, reflecting the system's dual nature - combining hard striking techniques with softer, circular movements for both offense and defense.

Miyagi studied under Kanryo Higaonna, who had trained in Chinese martial arts in Fuzhou, China. After Higaonna's death, Miyagi traveled to China to further his studies, eventually creating a synthesis of Chinese quanfa and traditional Okinawan martial arts.
