# Stances of Goju Ryu

A good working knowledge of the basic stances is a prerequisite to studying the kata and basics of Goju Ryu karate. Attention should be paid to weight distribution, balance and breathing.

## Musubi Dachi

Feet placed with heels touching and angled at about 60 degrees apart. The knees should be slightly bent with weight on the toes, not only onto the heels. This formal stance is used throughout training, before and after kata, during several of the kata and as a starting point.

## Sanchin Dachi

This is one of the stances for which our system is well known and is a very strong stance used throughout kata Sanchin and Tensho. This stance places the body-weight 50/50 on each foot with the feet shoulder width apart and pointing forward (the front foot can be slightly turned in). The heel of the front foot is on the same lateral line as the toes on the rear foot. So, it is a very short stance. A version of this stance, using less power and tension in the leg muscles is used in the other kata and basic training and may be referred to as Kihon Dachi or basic training stance.

## Zenkutsu Dachi

The front stance, this is a very strong attacking stance. The feet are shoulder width across and about three feet in length. Around 70% of the body weight is on the front leg. Hips are square and when moving, the student must use the hips and knees correctly to ensure smooth, balanced movement. The front stance is a very powerful, attacking stance and quite simple to learn but takes a lot of practice to move in a controlled manner, keeping the same height.

## Shiko Dachi

The straddle stance or four sided stance is a traditional karate position occurring in many kata. A great deal of training is required to be able to move freely in this stance. Once mastered, it is a very strong stance with the hips lowered deeply and is good for close quarter attack, providing the groin area is protected against attack! The feet are turned out at 45 degrees each, with weight distributed 50/50 on each foot.

## Neko Ashi Dachi

The cat stance. This stance is another for which the Goju Ryu system has become known. It is very effective as a defensive posture, with only around 10% of weight on the front foot, it can be used to spring into the attack or to shift position out of the way of an attack. The hips are square and weight lowered down onto the rear foot with thighs drawn close together. All of the advanced kata demonstrate ways in which this stance can be used. A lot of practice is needed in order to develop a powerful strike from this posture.
