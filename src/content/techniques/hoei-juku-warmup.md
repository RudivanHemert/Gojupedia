# Warm-up Exercises

The preliminary warm-up exercises which we use today in Goju-Ryu were systematically developed by Master Miyagi to benefit training in Goju-Ryu. The full warm-up routine not only serves to limber up the muscles but also provides a basis for improving our karate techniques.

## Purpose of Warm-up

Our warm-up routine is designed with the needs of the human body placed foremost. Strenuous karate training without warming up can lead to damage of the muscle tissue and ligaments. We have the added benefit that the stretching and breathing exercises greatly enhance the well-being of the body and all the major internal organs, as well as improving blood circulation.

## Meditation (Mokuso)

Before training the student meditates (Mokuso). Sitting quietly, eyes closed, breathing deeply into the lower abdomen (tanden). The mind should be cleared in preparation for the training to come, warming up the mind before warming the body. After training the student again meditates, breathing deeply, calming the mind and relaxing the body once more.

## Warm-up Sequence

We traditionally begin by warming the limbs and larger muscles furthest from the heart. This is done by beginning with the toes and ankles in stretching, then progressing to the knees, muscles of the lower and upper leg and then hips.

Several stretching breathing exercises can now be performed as we work the back area in all directions, following on to the shoulders, arms, elbows, wrists and fingers. Finally, to finish, the neck and head are moved through a full range of movement.

## Strength and Stamina Exercises

Exercises for physical strength and stamina, such as press-ups, abdominal exercises, squat thrusts etc. can then follow, once the body is thoroughly warmed.

## Breathing During Exercises

Students must be careful to exhale and inhale correctly during all exercises, using the tanden point, consciously being aware of balance and inner calm. For many health reasons, doing the preliminary exercises before starting the formal karate training is important.

Students should be aware of the routine used by instructors, since it will be based upon that designed by Master Miyagi and is proven to be a suitable preliminary exercise for Goju Ryu karate.

## Warm-down

Many of the exercises can be used as a warm-down after training to reduce any adverse effect of strenuous training upon the body. Warming down is just as important after strenuous exercise, it cools down body temperature gradually, reduces heart rate, normalises breathing and safely brings all internal organs back to their normal resting state.

## Additional Training

Additional supplementary exercises can be practiced by the student, such as Makiwara (striking post) and Tameshiwara (board-breaking) training. This type of training should only be practiced under the supervision of your instructor as incorrect technique can cause injury to the fingers, hands, wrists and elbows.

Juniors should refrain from Makiwara and Tameshiwara training, as the bones in the fingers and hand are not fully formed until their late teens. Many of the traditional training methods should be adapted, or omitted for younger people in karate practice.

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive Warming**: Start from extremities and work inward
2. **Mind-Body Connection**: Clear the mind before warming the body
3. **Proper Breathing**: Use tanden breathing throughout
4. **Balance Awareness**: Maintain balance and inner calm
5. **Gradual Intensity**: Build up intensity gradually
6. **Complete Range**: Move through full range of motion
7. **Safety First**: Never skip warm-up, especially for strenuous training
8. **Cool Down**: Always include proper warm-down after training
