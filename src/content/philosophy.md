## The Meaning of Goju-Ryu

"Go" means hard, referring to closed hand techniques and straight linear movements. "Ju" means soft, referring to open hand techniques and circular movements. Together, they represent the harmony of opposites that is central to the style's philosophy.

> "The way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness... Go and Ju."

## Dojo Kun (Training Hall Rules)

The Dojo Kun serves as a set of principles for students of karate. These principles are recited at the beginning and end of each training session to remind practitioners of the philosophical basis of their practice.

1.  **Seek Perfection of Character**
    Strive to improve yourself as a person, not just as a martial artist.
2.  **Be Faithful**
    Be sincere in your actions and loyal to those you care about.
3.  **Endeavor**
    Put effort into everything you do, especially when things get difficult.
4.  **Respect Others**
    Show courtesy and respect to all people, regardless of their status.
5.  **Refrain From Violent Behavior**
    Avoid using karate techniques to harm others unless absolutely necessary for self-defense.
