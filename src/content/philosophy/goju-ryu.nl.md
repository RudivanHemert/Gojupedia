[NL] # The Meaning of Goju-Ryu

[NL] Goju-Ryu, translating to "Hard-Soft Style," is a traditional Okinawan karate style deeply rooted in the principle of harmonizing contrasting forces. The name itself encapsulates its core philosophy:

[NL] *   **Go (剛):** Represents "hard" or "external." This aspect involves closed-hand techniques, direct linear movements, and the application of physical strength.
[NL] *   **Ju (柔):** Represents "soft" or "internal." This aspect emphasizes open-hand techniques, circular movements, and the development of *chi* (vital energy).

[NL] The style was formally named by its founder, Chojun Miyagi Sensei. He derived the terms "Go" and "Ju" from a line in the *Bubishi*, a classical Chinese martial arts text, specifically from the Kenpo Haku (Eight Poems of the Fist): *"Ho Go Ju donto"* (法剛柔呑吐), which translates to "The way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness."

[NL] Goju-Ryu seamlessly blends these hard and soft elements, combining powerful, direct attacks with fluid, circular blocks and evasive maneuvers. It's characterized by:

[NL] *   **Close-range combat:** Techniques are often designed for infighting.
[NL] *   **Breathing techniques (Ibuki and Ibuki Sankai):** Proper breathing is integral for power generation, focus, and connecting mind and body. Different breathing methods are used for different applications, some being audible and forceful, others silent and internal.
[NL] *   **Combination of Okinawan and Chinese principles:** It integrates native Okinawan fighting methods with both internal (soft, focused on chi and circularity) and external (hard, focused on physical power) Chinese martial concepts.
[NL] *   **Emphasis on Sanchin Kata:** This foundational kata, meaning "Three Battles," trains proper stance, breathing, tension, and the unification of mind, body, and spirit. Tensho kata, meaning "Rotating Palms," complements Sanchin by emphasizing the "Ju" aspects.

[NL] The ultimate goal in Goju-Ryu is not just physical prowess but the cultivation of a balanced individual, capable of adapting to any situation by applying hardness and softness appropriately, both in combat and in life.
