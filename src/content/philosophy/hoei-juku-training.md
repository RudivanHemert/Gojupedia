# Training in Goju Ryu Karate

## Reasons for Training

### It's Fun
Yes, it might feel like it hurts sometimes, but training is very enjoyable. Goju-Ryu is a mix of hard and soft movements and there is something there for everyone.

### Discipline and Character
Karate provides the young with an excellent example in discipline and manners. Training in a disciplined activity builds strength in the young to face challenges in the future. There is always the aim of achieving the next goal in training and more to be learnt.

### Health and Fitness
Compared to so many activities these days, Karate training need not be at all expensive. There are significant health and fitness benefits from regular exercise.

### Personal Development
Training in Karate teaches the ability to behave equally graciously in success and in failure. By attending classes regularly, there are great benefits in meeting other people and travelling. Training develops a keen sense of awareness necessary to respond when confronted by threats in life.

## Aims and Objectives

At the Ho-Ei Juku, you will experience training in a traditional Martial Art (several 'arts' are available). There is the opportunity to attend seminars and competition opportunities if needed. The Organisation can provide the opportunity to travel, including Japan and Okinawa, for training.

All instructors provide great care to all Ho-Ei Juku members in a manner that is fair to all, now and in the future and seek to promote the Art of Goju-Ryu within the community.

## Dojo Rules

As a member of the Ho-Ei Juku, you are expected to abide by the following rules:

- Train within the traditional format taught, respect senior grades and their decisions.
- Keep to training times laid down as lateness in arriving to training can inconvenience all.
- Wear a suitably clean, tidy Karate uniform, correctly coloured belt and Ho-Ei Juku badge.
- Pay the appropriate fees for membership, training and grading promptly.
- Refrain from physical, or verbal abuse, which will not be tolerated at any time.

## Child Protection Policy

The Ho-Ei Juku is keen to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants at all times, especially children and vulnerable adults who may be involved with the club. To help with this, we have adopted the Child-protection Policy laid down by the EKFA. A copy of this is available online, or any time for inspection in the classes.

## Health & Safety

There is a fixed etiquette in training which, if followed carefully, will remove, or significantly reduce, the risks of training in a contact activity. The Ho-Ei Juku instructors have strict guidelines concerning coaching and safety is most important.

We take all practical steps to safeguard students and visitors from injury whilst training and insist that anyone training with us follows the instruction given. This is for the safety of all concerned.

## Equal Opportunities

Goju-Ryu Karate-Do Ho-Ei Juku is open to all serious Martial Artists and does not discriminate on the grounds of age, sex, colour, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, or physical disability. Known illnesses may require a letter from your doctor to confirm that you are fit to train.

Please note that we are unable to accept people to train under the age of 5, or over 70 as we cannot offer insurance to allow them to train in the Martial Arts.

## Data Protection

Any information is recorded, stored and destroyed strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## The Kyu/Dan Grade System

The system of using coloured belts to denote rank is not traditional but a relatively new practice, being adopted by Karate practitioners after the introduction of Karate to mainland Japan and following the pattern of belts used in Judo. The colours used are not universal, although there is generally agreement on the minimum time taken between promotions.

### Belt System

- **Beginner**: White belt - minimum 3 months to first promotion
- **10th Kyu**: Yellow belt - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **9th Kyu**: Yellow belt + stripe - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **8th Kyu**: Orange belt - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **7th Kyu**: Orange belt + stripe - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **6th Kyu**: Green belt - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **5th Kyu**: Green belt + stripe - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **4th Kyu**: Blue belt - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **3rd Kyu**: Blue belt + stripe - minimum 3 months to next promotion
- **2nd Kyu**: Brown belt - minimum 6 months to next promotion
- **1st Kyu**: Brown belt + stripe - minimum 6 months to next promotion
- **1st Dan**: Black belt - minimum 2 years to next promotion
- **2nd Dan**: Black belt - minimum 3 years to next promotion
- **3rd Dan**: Black belt - minimum 4 years to next promotion

The above guideline is based upon training regularly several times each week and making steady progress through the syllabus. Times between grades indicated here are a minimum and it may take rather longer, depending upon individual progress made in training.

Any variation to the above will require the consideration of the teacher, or examiner. Anyone joining from another club will be allowed to wear their existing belt until training with the Ho-Ei Juku for up to 6 months, by which time they should have achieved a belt, or grade within this Organisation.

Although the Dan grades wear black belts, it is possible for 6th Dan and above to adopt the red and white belt as is done in Judo and increasingly popular in Karate too. The red and white belt is awarded by the Sensei to most senior ranks to demonstrate their outstanding contributions to training, teaching and developing the Art.
