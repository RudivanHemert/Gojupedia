# Origins of Goju Ryu and Hoei Juku

## The Chinese Roots

The origins and lineage of Goju Ryu can be traced back with certainty to the founder of Whooping Crane Kung Fu; Xie Zhong Xiang (1852-1930). He was also called Ryu Ryu Ko and was born in Chang-le, Fujian. In his early years, he studied Ming He Quan boxing.

In 1883, he set up a martial arts centre and started to receive students and pass on his style of Chinese boxing with its own special and unique characteristics. He was a first generation master (Shi) of Whooping Crane Boxing. Many believe that Xie was the teacher of Higashionna Kanryo and other turn-of-the-century Okinawan martial artists.

Whether this was truly his real name and picture or his actual birth and death date, Whooping Crane strikingly resembles Goju Ryu and definitely plays a generous role in many other Okinawan as well as Goju Ryu practices. Defined particularly in kata such as Suparunpai, Kururunfa, Saifa, etc; those Kata brought back to Okinawa from China each demonstrate specific movements from White Crane.

## Higashionna Kanryo (1851-1917)

Higashionna Kanryo was born in Naha, Okinawa, which is now a prefecture of Japan. As so much evidence was lost during the destruction of Okinawa in World War 2, some aspects are difficult to confirm. However, Higashionna Kanryo, having been born to a poor family, was reputed to have earned his living transporting firewood from the Kerama Island.

Despite being very small in size, he had unparalleled speed and agility. Kanryo Higaonna is known as the founder and highest authority of Naha-Te and was a student of Ryu Ryu Ko. He is considered one of the earliest and foremost masters of Okinawan Karate and regarded as one of the most influential Karate instructors in Okinawan history.

Higashionna-Sensei sailed from Okinawa in 1866, at the age of 15 or 16 to further his studies in Fuzchou, China, in the arts of Chinese boxing with Ryu Ryu Ko and remained there for 15 to 20 years. When he returned to Okinawa he introduced a new, effective school of Karate there, distinguished from other styles by its integration of Go-no (hard) and Ju-no (soft) Kempo into one system.

Higaonna was noted for his powerful Sanchin Kata. Sometimes he would permit four men to attempt to push him out of his stance, but they were always unable to move him. It is said that after finishing his Sanchin Kata, the wooden floor would be hot from the mere grip of his toes. His most prominent and best student was Chojun Miyagi, the founder of Goju-Ryu.

## Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953)

Chojun Miyagi was born April 25th 1888 in Higashi-Machi (Naha-shi) Okinawa. When Miyagi Sensei was 11 years old, his mother took him to a karate master named Aragaki Ryuko. At the dojo of Aragaki Sensei, he trained mainly on makiwara, chishi, and nigiri-game, which were used to strengthen and develop the muscles.

Later he introduced the young Miyagi to Higashionna Sensei. After watching the young Miyagi carrying out all of the chores around the house, the traditional way of being accepted, Higashionna Sensei decided to have him as a personal disciple, and started to teach him his art.

Miyagi Sensei's training was not confined just to the dojo. He ran every day from his High School, where he had enrolled previously, and he was seen at the harbour as well. Miyagi did a lot of body conditioning before he went to Higashionna's dojo, but still found the training extremely hard and demanding.

Higashionna's training was exhaustive, and Miyagi would pass out many an evening. Although the training was very hard, Miyagi was enthusiastic about his karate, and Higashionna Sensei was already thinking of him as his successor. Both were already working on the practice of kata and on the improvement of Naha-te. They stayed together for 15 years.

## Miyagi's Development of Goju Ryu

After training with Higashionna Sensei, Miyagi sailed to China in May of 1915 in search of his Higashionna's teacher. This was one of three trips he made to China during his lifetime. During his quest he studied Chinese boxing in Fouchow, Fukien Province, from 1915 to 1917. He studied not only the building blocks of his teacher's art Hung Gar-Shaolin Chuan Chi-Chi, but also I-Chuan, Pa Kua Chang and Tai Chi Chuan. All of these were softer but highly skilled and effective styles.

It was at this time he learned the Kata Rokkishu, which later became the building block for Kata Tensho. With this additional martial art training Okinawa-te, Naha-te and the Chinese arts, Sensei Miyagi developed a refined form of empty hand, although even today its Whooping Crane Chinese Kung Fu roots can still be seen in its forms or Kata.

## The Naming of Goju Ryu

The naming of Goju-Ryu came about more by accident than design. In 1929 one of Chojun Miyagi Sensei's disciples, Jinan Shinzato, was in Kyoto, Japan for a large martial arts convention to demonstrate Naha-te. After the performance he was asked to what school of karate he belonged. As Naha-te had no formal name he could not answer this question.

Feeling his art would be looked down upon he answered "Hango-ryu", which means the Way of Half Hard. Unable to accurately reply he returned to Okinawa and consulted Miyagi Sensei. He chose the name "Goju Ryu" (the hard-soft style), inspired by the "Eight precepts" of Kempo, written in the Bubishi; quoting from the third verse of a Chinese Bubishi poem, the Eight Poems of the Fist: "The way of inhaling and exhaling is hardness and softness."

It is from this poem that the art Miyagi studied and taught got its name; Goju-Ryu, the school of hard and soft.

## The Legacy Continues

Following what is now known as the Meeting of the Masters, Mr. Miyagi along with others who attended formed the 'Great Japan Martial Arts Karate Teachers Association' or 'Dai Nippon Butokukai Karate Jutsu-Kyoshi' in 1937. Before the Second World War, Chojun Miyagi travelled widely and was involved in many projects to spread karate throughout mainland Japan and the rest of the world.

Chojun Miyagi passed away on October 8th, 1953. He had not named a successor at the time of his death; leaving an unprecedented mark in the world of Karate-do and from his famous Garden Dojo, there were enough legendary students to carry his name into the history books of Martial Arts as the 'Master'.

He predicted that during the twentieth century karate would spread throughout the world. Today we can see that this prediction has been realized, karate is not only practiced in Japan, but it can be found throughout the world. Karate is no longer a solely Okinawan or Japanese martial art; it has become an art with no boundaries, an art for people all over the world.
