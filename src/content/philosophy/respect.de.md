[DE] # Respect in Martial Arts

[DE] Respect (Reigi - 礼儀) is a foundational pillar of Goju-Ryu Karate and all traditional martial arts. It is not merely a suggestion but an integral part of the training, woven into every interaction and practice within the dojo and expected to extend into daily life. The Goju-Ryu Dojo Kun explicitly states, *"Hitotsu Reigi O Omon Zuru Koto"* (Respect others), and its five precepts include, *"We are courteous in manners."

[DE] ## Dimensions of Respect in Goju-Ryu:

[DE] 1.  **Respect for Oneself (Jison - 自尊):**
[DE]     This begins with self-care – maintaining personal hygiene, wearing a clean and neat gi (uniform), and striving for self-improvement. It involves recognizing one's own potential and taking responsibility for one's actions and development.

[DE] 2.  **Respect for Instructors (Sensei - 先生) and Seniors (Senpai - 先輩):**
[DE]     Instructors and senior students are shown respect for their knowledge, experience, and dedication to guiding others. This is demonstrated by:
[DE]     *   Listening attentively to instruction.
[DE]     *   Responding promptly and with sincerity (e.g., with "Oss").
[DE]     *   Following dojo rules and instructor guidance.
[DE]     *   Valuing the time and effort they invest in teaching.

[DE] 3.  **Respect for Training Partners (Dōhai - 同輩) and Juniors (Kōhai - 後輩):**
[DE]     All practitioners, regardless of rank, are treated with consideration and courtesy. This means:
[DE]     *   Training safely and cooperatively, being mindful of a partner's abilities and well-being.
[DE]     *   Being humble in victory and gracious in defeat during kumite (sparring).
[DE]     *   Supporting and encouraging fellow students in their training journey.

[DE] 4.  **Respect for the Dojo (道場 - Training Hall):**
[DE]     The dojo is a special place of learning and development. Respect is shown by:
[DE]     *   Bowing (rei) upon entering and leaving the dojo.
[DE]     *   Helping to keep the dojo clean and orderly.
[DE]     *   Maintaining a serious and focused attitude during training.
[DE]     *   Treating training equipment with care.

[DE] 5.  **Respect for the Art and its Traditions:**
[DE]     This involves valuing the history, philosophy, and techniques of Goju-Ryu Karate passed down through generations. It includes a commitment to preserving the integrity of the art.

[DE] ## Manifestations of Respect:

[DE] *   **Bowing (Rei - 礼):** The bow is a primary physical expression of respect. It is performed at the beginning and end of class, when partnering for drills, and when entering or leaving the dojo. It signifies humility, gratitude, and acknowledgement.
[DE] *   **Etiquette (Reishiki - 礼式):** Adherence to dojo etiquette – the established rules of conduct – demonstrates respect for the training environment and its participants.
[DE] *   **Language and Attitude:** Using polite language, maintaining a humble attitude, and showing genuine attentiveness are all part of practicing respect.

[DE] ## The Deeper Meaning:

[DE] Respect in Goju-Ryu is not about blind obedience but about fostering an environment conducive to learning, growth, and mutual well-being. It acknowledges the inherent worth of each individual and the value of the shared journey in martial arts. By cultivating respect, practitioners develop not only their technical skills but also their character, contributing to a more disciplined, harmonious, and ethical approach to life.
