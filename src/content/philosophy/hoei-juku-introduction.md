# Hoei Juku Introduction

## Welcome to Goju Ryu Karate Do Hoei Juku

It has been my intention to write this student handbook for a very long time. With years of note-making and seminar note preparation, plus assorted leaflets for the clubs, there is an abundance of material in circulation just waiting to be collated into one volume without too many pictures and with the essential information needed to gain a clearer understanding of Karate and in particular of Goju-Ryu Karate.

With the incorporation of our own web-based links for visual performance of movements in our style of Karate, I believe this is the perfect combination of easily accessible information and action images that can be used to follow the movements. Despite this, I am well aware that this small volume can not answer all the questions or truly reflect the Art in its entirety.

Therefore, this training manual is not intended to replace constant, regular training in a karate dojo under the guidance of an experienced Black Belt instructor. So, by taking on board all the information in this handbook and asking any further questions of your own Sensei, you will be able to gain more than just the great benefits of health and fitness.

## The Purpose of Training

There are many advantages to learning a Martial Art and to do this completely, it is also necessary to take on board the history and origins of the Art, the language used in practicing that Art and the details required to achieve a senior level within the Association.

Considering this, I hope that you practice hard on the techniques of Goju-Ryu, as there are so many physical aspects to this form of Karate with its techniques, forms, body-conditioning and pair work. Study hard too, in order to learn the roots of the Art and be able to transmit this information to future generations of Martial Artists.

## Preserving the Art

In this way, we will all be able to maintain, as much as is possible, something close to the spirit of the Art as it was practiced by the great names in Japanese, Okinawan and Chinese Martial Arts over the centuries. Now that Karate is a household word around the world, it can so easily become no more than a shadow of its original form.

Influences such as modern competition, financial incentives, egotistical individuals or merely the lack of information can change what was taken from Okinawa to mainland Japan in the 1920s and 1930s to the point where it is almost unrecognisable as the same Art.

## The True Way of Karate

I have found over the years that a great many students train in Karate without really worrying about which style it is, who the Masters were in the history of the Art and so on. To some extent, the style itself is less important than the way in which you are training, the effort made by both teachers and students.

It is my intention therefore to attempt to record many of the points that can often be ignored or forgotten in our hurry to get fitter, to lose weight, even to gain the coveted black belt. Whilst it is important to set your own goals and timelines in training, it is also essential, in my mind, to remember that Karate-Do, the Way of the Empty Hand, is a true 'Way', and must retain the aspects of respect, humility, self-control and discipline that separate any Art from the many forms of kick-boxing, cage-fighting and other systems of training and competing in physical violence.

The hardest part of Karate training should be to overcome our own inner weaknesses in pursuit of true Karate performance.

## Modern Resources

Finally, with the advent of modern internet technology, we are able to provide various downloadable materials, links to movie clips and other resources including a photo gallery on our website. The content of this does change from time to time, so for more information, please refer to www.hoeijuku.com

I wish you well in your study and practice of Goju-Ryu Karate.
