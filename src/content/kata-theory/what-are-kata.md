## What are Kata?

Kata are individual exercises consisting of a number of different techniques that follow each other in a fixed and logical way. The execution is prescribed in detail. Although they do not contain all the techniques of a particular style, they do contain most of them and all the basic principles regarding combat scenarios, posture, power delivery, and so on.

Kata are a central part of the practice of karate and are characteristic of a particular style. The kata of Goju ryu are divided into heishugata (closed hand) and kaishugata (open hand). In the "closed hand" kata, the tanden is continuously closed. This means that your lower abdomen is continuously tensed and your pelvis is tilted backwards, as if the breath in the lower abdomen is rolled up. In the "open hand" kata, the tanden is only closed at the moment of focus. They are characterized by the alternation of tension and relaxation.

Goju-Ryu has 12 kata, two of which are heishugata: Sanchin and Tensho. Sanchin is trained in two forms: the form taught by Sensei Kanryo Higaonna and the Sanchin developed by Chojun Miyagi, the founder of our style. The other 10 kata are kaishugata. These are Gekisai dai ichi, Gekisai dai ni, Saifa, Seiyunchin, Shisochin, Sanseru, Sepai, Kururunfa, Sesan and Peichuin.

The kata were developed by masters in the martial arts and it is often not known who, when and why created the kata. Because the original intention of the creator is often unknown, it is undesirable to change a kata.
