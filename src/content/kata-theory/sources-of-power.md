## Sources of Power

The way power is converted into movement and impact differs in each technique. Three ways can be distinguished in which power is developed in Goju-ryu karate. The three sources of power are: generating from the ground (pushing force), discharging power (discharge or spring power), and falling (gravity). In addition, muscle power can also be used, but in our system, there is no single movement in which power is derived exclusively from muscle power.

### Power from the Ground (Push-off Force)

This power is obtained by pushing off against the ground. It occurs in various gradations. It is always based on a push that is converted into a pelvic movement. For example, when pushing off for a push (oshi), or a step (ashi), possibly combined with a punch. Power is also derived from the ground when pushing off for a punch where the pelvis turns inward, such as the gyaku zuki (reverse punch) in Gekisai dai ichi or as a smaller and more subtle movement in tanden zuki, for example.

A grounded and centered karateka can generate more or less power from the ground in almost all techniques and uses this for a power impulse from the legs and pelvis. The reaction of (the mass of) the opponent at the moment of impact (action = - reaction) is often absorbed by directing it to the ground (see also chinkuchi kakin in the next paragraph).

### Discharging Power (Discharge or Spring Power)

This power is obtained by releasing a pre-tension of the muscles, comparable to an arrow that flies away after the string of the tensioned bow is released. It is clearly present in the upward elbow lift/liberation technique (hiji age) in Seiyunchin, where the body is first curled up and released during the execution of the liberation technique.

It is more subtly present in, for example, the knife hand strike (shuto uchi) in Gekisai dai ichi, where the shoulder blades are first pulled apart and snap back during the execution of the shuto uchi. Additionally, the body part performing the action can be held against, after which it shoots out or back when it is released. This happens, for example, in the backward elbow strike (ushiro hiji ate) in Seiyunchin, where the fist of the executing arm is initially held back by the other hand.

### Power through Gravity

This power is obtained by letting your body or a body part fall. The cross block (kosa uke) in Sanseru and the double punch with the middle finger fist (morote nakadaka ippon zuki) in Sepai are examples where the power is derived from falling into a deep shiko dachi. Examples of dropping a body part are the downward block (otoshi uke) in Seiyunchin and the low swing strike (gedan furi uchi) in Saifa.
