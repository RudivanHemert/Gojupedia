## Transferring and Processing Power

Transferring power primarily relates to punches, strikes, and kicks; processing power to blocks and evasions. For the transfer of power, it is of course important whether it concerns an arm or leg technique, but also whether it is a strike (circular) or a punch (straight).

### Strikes and Punches

A punch is generally straight-line. At the moment of hitting, there is always focus. A strike generally has a circular path. With a 'heavy strike', the impact is determined by the speed and mass of the arm or leg (te no omomi). A 'tough strike' is focused, and the joints are fixed briefly at the moment of hitting. An example is the circular strike (mawashi furi zuki) in Sepai and the hammer strike (tettsui uchi) in Saifa.

With a 'continuous strike', the circular path of the technique is, as it were, pulled 'through the opponent's body'. Depending on the degree of muscle tension at the moment of hitting, this resembles a heavy or tough strike. The last is the 'whip strike'. Here, the arm or foot snaps back after hitting. There is no focus, and these techniques are performed without tension in the muscles and joints of the upper body. Such techniques have less impact and are performed at the beginning of combinations or with attacks to vital points. For example, the knuckle strike (uraken uchi) in the Gekisai dai's and the uraken uchi in Saifa and Seiyunchin towards the vital point just above the upper lip (jinchu).

Not all movements are focused at one moment. These are generally continuous movements, for example, certain blocks that are performed in a more or less circular movement. The karateka must ensure that during the execution in the kata, the attention goes to the imaginary (sometimes sliding) point of contact of this movement. This is the case with many blocks, such as the tora uchi ("tiger mouth"), the pulling block (hiki uke) in Saifa, and many subtle blocks in the higher kata.

Pushing and pulling are also not focused at the moment of contact. There is no hard contact, and the movement is performed over a longer trajectory. The power for the push is always generated from the ground.

### Kicks

In the classification of kicks, the terms 'keage' and 'kekomi' are used. Keage concerns a striking kick. This is less focused at the moment of hitting and is generally performed without pelvic tilting/rotation, possibly with a (small) pelvic stretch. They are often directed at vital points such as the crotch (with the ball of the foot in the Gekisai's, Saifa, Shisochin, Sanseru, and Kururunfa) or the testicles (with the instep or ball of the foot) in kin geri.

Kekomi concerns a thrusting kick. This is always focused, and the use of the pelvis is explicitly used. Almost all kicks in the kata are keage; only the side kick (kansetsu geri) in Sanseru is kekomi. Kekomi kicks must, however, be trained frequently (it is stated that for a good development of the muscles for kicks, about half should be performed on a punching cushion or makiwara).

### Blocks and Evasions

As a self-defense art, karate of course deals with blocks and evasions. The most confrontational is the hard, colliding block (very "go"), where there is no evasion and the attack is completely blocked. Here, you train not only maintaining your own space but also the correct posture during this hard confrontation; you learn "not to step aside". Comparable to this, but somewhat more difficult, is pushing back the attack. Here, as a defender, you penetrate the attacker's space. So you come forward while blocking. The execution of the open hand block (shotei uchi uke) simultaneously with the forward movement of the entire body in Seiyunchin is an example of this.

A third possibility for "blocking" is absorbing the attack. Of course, the muscles are tensed at the moment of contact; not every body part lends itself equally well to this. An example of a technique with a body "that can take a hit" is with the so-called "noon-breathing". Here, you hold your breath so that the body remains tense. The low sweeping block (gedan harai uke) with the open hand push (shotei oshi) in Sepai is performed with this breathing. When absorbing a force, you can absorb the opponent's power and use it in your subsequent technique. In kaki-e, you practice this, and it is also called 'swallowing-and-spitting'.

With deflection, the force of the opponent's action is caught and changed in direction in a circular movement and guided past you. This is the most common block in the kata. It can also happen that when deflecting, the opponent's force is extended, as is the case with a pulling block (hiki uke).

The last block is the evasion. Here, the opponent's force is no longer absorbed. Ideally, not only is an evasion made so that the attack misses, but a strategically favorable position is also taken for a counterattack. Try to get the opponent off balance and ensure that after the evasion, you end up in a fighting posture that is also suitable for attacking. Of course, you train such an evasion with all larger side and backward movements from the kata.
