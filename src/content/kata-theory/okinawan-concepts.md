## Six Okinawan Concepts

Before discussing the transfer and processing of power, six Okinawan concepts are explained that are frequently used and relate to the execution of techniques. There are (many) more concepts, but these six are the most important. They appear frequently in all kata. It is not necessary to know them to enjoy karate training (a lot goes well on its own), but understanding these terms may provide better insight into the movement and possibilities for improvement.

The terms are chinkuchi kakin, muchimi, chiru no chan chan, chikara nu nujisashi, te no omomi, and shimeijurasan.

### Chinkuchi Kakin (Kime)

Chinkuchi kakin is a (short) tension of the muscles at the moment of hitting; it is also referred to as 'kime' or 'focus'. The term refers to the short contraction of the muscles which fixes the joints at the moment of hitting and focuses the concentration on the point of contact. The stance is strengthened by fixing the muscles and joints of ankles, knees, and pelvis (briefly) and grabbing the ground with the feet. After the moment of hitting, the body is immediately relaxed and the joints released, ready for the next action.

Chinkuchi kakin consists of two components that (ultimately) work together. On one hand, the momentary tensing of the muscles that provides stability and prevents the weight of the opponent from rebounding. For this, the stance is grounded, and the muscles, especially in the lower body, are tensed. On the other hand, there is a focus on the connection between the point of hitting and the tanden. The power is directed outward; you 'extend' the technique (imaginatively) in the direction where the power is being thrust.

Chinkuchi kakin provides a stable stance when punching, blocking, and kicking (and enables faster movements). It is more or less present in all techniques, explicitly in punches and kicks, because they end with a focus (and least in continuous, non-focused movements).

You develop chinkuchi kakin by focusing well and correctly tensing and relaxing the muscles during kihon and kata. It is present in all movements of the kata and can thus be trained continuously. Ensure relaxed movements with a good kime at the moment of hitting, strive for a connection between tanden and the point of contact, such as the knuckles. Stay well-grounded and move from your pelvis. Especially the Gekisai dai-kata with their simple alternation between tension and relaxation are very suitable for practicing kime. The less focus in a technique, the less chinkuchi kakin. Punches and kekomi kicks therefore have more chinkuchi kakin than strikes and striking, keage kicks.

### Muchimi

Movements with muchimi are heavy and sticky, but flowing movements. Execution is slow, controlled, continuous, and concentrated, from overview, calmness, and alertness. The movement builds up tension that is palpable and starts from the ground and the tanden. It is used for techniques that deliver power over a longer distance, such as controlling blocks (osae uke), locks (kansetsu waza), strangulations (jime waza), liberation techniques (hazushi waza), pushing and pulling movements (oshi and hiki waza); especially techniques in the medium and short-distance fight. Because these movements require a lot of power to be delivered for a long time, they are always supported by the large muscles of the lower body and the torso.

Movements with muchimi occur in all kata. You train muchimi not only in the kata but also by moving weights, such as the chi ishi and the nigiri game (grip vases). Application of muchimi with a partner can be trained during kakie. Keep paying attention to the execution from the bottom and the pelvis.

### Chiru No Chan Chan

Chiru no chan chan is described as explosion power, spring power, starting power, beginning power, push-off power, or initial impulse. It relates to the power input at the beginning of the movement. Execution is from legs and pelvis. The concept also includes a quick reaction to an action, like a starting shot or a click; in combat, a reaction to a shoulder movement, a pelvic insert, or - in close-range combat - a change in balance. The concept is somewhat broader and also includes the state of the muscles, which for chiru no chan chan must be steel-hard but also flexible and springy.

Chiru no chan chan is present in every movement, more explicitly in techniques with a powerful initial impulse such as throws, release techniques, and strikes. You get a powerful, quick push-off by moving a lot in/to/from shiko dachi. But knee bends (squats) and jumps are also suitable for this. Seiyunchin, with its many shiko dachi's and low, substantial body movements, is an important kata for the development of chiru no chan chan.

### Chikara Nu Nujisashi

Chikara nu nujisashi is the in and out of power. It refers to the interplay of power when following up techniques. The basis for a good execution is the relaxation of the muscles after tensing at the moment of contact of a technique (also part of chinkuchi kakin). This makes it possible to 'thrust' the power from the tanden and 'bring it back in' to the tanden, so it can be used for a next technique/action. The power then goes 'in' (during relaxation and inhalation: rest) - out (tensing, executing technique, exhaling: action) - in (relaxing: rest) - out (action) - in (rest)... and so on. Chikara no nijisashi should be present in every series of movements.

You can train chikara no nujisaschi in all series of techniques by consciously paying attention to tension and relaxation, inhalation and exhalation, and retrieving and pushing out power from the tanden. All kata are therefore suitable for developing this technique, especially the Gekisai dai-kata with their clear rhythm. Incidentally, many people count in their heads along with the movements of the kata, as is also done in class. This is initially fine, but as one becomes more practiced, this can be replaced by the rhythm of breathing.

Closely related to the term chikara nu nujisashi is chikara no kyojaku (literal translation: power of hard and soft). This term refers to the correct application of tension and relaxation (and thus correct execution of power) in techniques and actions.

### Te No Omomi

The term te no omomi (literally: heavy hands) refers to the use of relaxed arms or legs during the execution of a technique. The impact of the technique in te no omomi comes from the weight and speed given to a body part. You only use the weight of the body part concerned (and the impulse you have given it). By keeping the body part relaxed, it has more impact to be effective. Examples are a falling, downward block (otoshi uke) with a relaxed arm, a circular kick (mawashi geri) or swing kick (furi geri) with a relaxed leg, and all strikes, which indeed only use the weight and speed of the arm.

Te no omomi can be well trained in kihon, on the makiwara, or with cushions and partner. Most kata include te no omomi techniques. Examples are the low sweeping block (gedan barai) in the Gekisai dai-kata and the swing strike (furi uchi) and the thumb hand strike (haito uchi) in Saifa.

### Shimeijurasan

Shimeijurasan refers to the perfect execution of the kata. It is the unattainable goal that everyone should (regularly) strive for.
