# What is Kumite?

Kumite (組手) is the practice of sparring or fighting in karate. It is one of the three main components of karate training, alongside kata (forms) and kihon (basics).

## Meaning

Kumite literally means "grappling hands" and refers to the practice of fighting techniques with a partner. It is the practical application of the techniques learned in kata and kihon training.

## Purpose of Kumite

Kumite serves several important purposes in karate training:

- **Practical Application**: Tests techniques in realistic situations
- **Timing and Distance**: Develops sense of ma-ai (fighting distance)
- **Mental Discipline**: Builds confidence and mental toughness
- **Physical Conditioning**: Improves fitness and reflexes
- **Tactical Thinking**: Develops strategy and decision-making

## Importance in Karate

Kumite is essential for developing practical fighting skills in karate. It bridges the gap between kata practice and real self-defense situations, while developing physical, mental, and spiritual qualities necessary for martial arts mastery.
