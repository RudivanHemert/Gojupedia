        In 1930, Miyagi performed in Hawaii, helping to introduce Goju-Ryu to the Western world. After World War II, Goju-Ryu spread

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Today, Goju-Ryu is practiced worldwide with various organizations preserving different aspects of Miyagi's teachings.

        teachings of Chojun Miyagi.
