        Kanryo Higaonna was born on March 10, 1853, in the Nishimura district of Naha, Okinawa, as the fourth child of Kanyo Higaonna and his wife Makado. 
        Being one of seven children, with his older brothers either deceased or weak, Kanryo took on significant responsibilities at a young age.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        His father was a merchant who owned a boat, transporting goods between Okinawa and other Ryukyu islands. From the age of ten, Kanryo worked with his father, 
        developing great physical strength in his arms and legs from the heavy labor. When Kanryo was fourteen, a ceremony was held to mark his transition to adulthood.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Shortly after, in 1867 or 1868, Kanryo's father was killed in a fight. Determined to avenge his father's death, Kanryo decided to travel to China to study martial arts. 
        To receive permission to travel, he claimed he was going to study. With the help of a government official named Udon Yoshimura, Kanryo obtained permission to travel to China as a student.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Sometime between 1868 and 1870, at around 16 or 17 years of age, Kanryo departed for Fuzhou, China. After arriving, he was introduced to the renowned martial arts master Ryu Ryu Ko, 
        who accepted him as a student. Kanryo underwent a formal ceremony, lighting incense at the school's altar and taking an oath to train diligently and lead a virtuous life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Ryu Ryu Ko was highly respected in Fuzhou, estimated to be between 50 and 65 years old when Kanryo met him. He was reportedly tall, slender, and extremely strong. Coming from a noble family 
        that had lost its status during civil unrest, Ryu Ryu Ko had worked as a mason before switching to bamboo crafting.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Initially, Kanryo was taught only the Sanchin kata. Training was intense, and Kanryo was amazed by Ryu Ryu Ko's strength and knowledge. Soon, Kanryo became an uchi-deshi (live-in student), 
        helping his master with bamboo work during the day and training in the garden every evening.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Kanryo trained extensively with specialized equipment like Nigirigamae (grip jars), Chi-ishi (stone handle weights), Ishi-sashi (stone padlocks), Tan (barbells), and a type of Makiwara (striking post). 
        Despite injuries and bruises, Kanryo never stopped training. He particularly enjoyed practicing throwing and ground techniques with another student in a large round basket.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        After 11 to 13 years of dedicated training, Ryu Ryu Ko, by then an old man, instructed Kanryo to return to Okinawa. Kanryo left Fuzhou in 1881, deeply grateful for his master's instruction and guidance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Upon returning to Okinawa during a time of political unrest, Kanryo resumed his work as a merchant, trading between islands. Initially reluctant to teach martial arts, he eventually yielded to persistent 
        requests and began instructing a small group of selected students at his home, focusing solely on the Sanchin kata.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        By 1905, Kanryo's reputation had spread throughout Okinawa. He was invited to teach at the Naha Commercial School, where he modified his teaching method. For school students, he introduced closed-fist 
        techniques in Sanchin kata and slowed the breathing to emphasize physical strength and balance between body and mind, rather than deadly techniques. However, he continued to teach the original Chinese 
        methods to a select group at his home, including the young Chojun Miyagi.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Kanryo's reputation was challenged by another martial arts teacher named Kojo, who claimed his art was superior. A contest in Sanchin kata was arranged, judged by a renowned doctor from mainland Japan. 
        The doctor observed that in Kanryo's performance, his feet were firmly planted, all muscles tensed, and his entire body engaged. In contrast, Kojo's muscles were only tensed vertically, resulting in imprecise 
        muscle tension. Kanryo was deemed superior, and Kojo graciously acknowledged his greater skill.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        This event further solidified Kanryo's reputation across Okinawa. Until 1905, "Te" (as it was known then) was a secret art taught only to selected students. After Kanryo began teaching at the Naha Commercial School, 
        karate became more widespread and accessible to the general population.
